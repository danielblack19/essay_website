<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee was well-known as an influential creator within the 20th century. He was the inventor of the Internet in 1989. This essay will explore who he was, the worldwide web and its history and how he was able to change and sculpt how we live today and also the future. My main focus is on how Tim Berners-Lee has affected our society and made changes to it, as well as how he will sculp the future. </p>

<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<br>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee was born in London, England 1955. Berners-Lee began at a young age to have an interest in trains and train spotting. From a young age Berners-Lee learned a lot about electronics whilst he played with a model railway. Both his parents had input into the invention of the first commercial computer, also known as Ferranti Mark I, so it was inevitable that Berners-Lee would have a knowledge related to computers.</p>

<section class="text2">
        <p>After graduating from University of Oxford in 1976 he began to design software, as a Computer Scientist and his biggest and most rewarding invention was the World Wide Web in 1989, whilst working at CERN (European Organisation of Nuclear Research), a swiss based company for software engineering.</p>
</section>
<br>
<p>Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web and originally had intentions for it to be used to allow the demands for automated information sharing between other scientists within universities and institutes around the world to be met.</p>
<br>


<p class="figure2text">Figure 2 which can be found on the CERN website shows the first concept of the World Wide Web. It is very basic. It does not look like a normal webpage which we are familiar with today.</p>
<br>   
<br> 
<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<br>
<p>The history, the internet does not date back very far. In fact, it only dates back to around 30 years ago, to 1989. As stated above, its inventor was Tim Berners-Lee, with his idea for sharing information around the world. Although in very basic form, it allowed him to complete the task. </p>

<section class="text1">
        <p>Berners-Lee developed the code for the first ever web server on a NeXT computer. (Website: CERN). This was a very important piece of equipment to Tim ass it was his key to his future success, without this computer none of Berners-Lee’s ideas would become reality. Within CERN workplace, the NeXT computer could have been used by someone else or turn off, in order to make sure it was not turned off, the computer had a hand-written label in red ink, saying, “This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!” (Website: CERN Short Web History). </p>
</section>
<br>
<p>To begin his ideas, Tim Berners-Lee had to have a proposal of what he wanted to achieve from his thoughts. He created a proposal plan to convey ideas. Figure 4 is the first proposal of the World Wide Web, written in March 1989. Within this you can gain an understanding of what Tim wanted to do and how he wanted to do it. Although it looks like a puzzle, it made sense to him and just think about where this proposal has taken the world today.</p>

<p>A brief insight of the history of the World Wide Web, how it began as an idea to help universities communicate, as well as the proposal Tim had and the device it was first ran from. This next section will discuss how we use the World wide web and the changes it has made to the society we live in. </p>
<br>

<h2 id="Changes">Changes</h2>
<br>
<p>Today, many people own a mobile device. This makes it easy for a new generation to gain access to the Internet. According to a website source there are 5.11 billion unique mobile device users in the world today. (wearesocial.com, Simon Kemp, 2019). There are 7.7 billion people living on planet earth according to a survey in December 2019. It is astonishing that nearly every person will own a mobile device. </p>
<br>
<p>In terms of the internet, there 4.39 billion internet users in the world today, compared to the total population, this is more than half of the population having access to the Internet. (wearesocial.com, Simon Kemp, 2019). It is astonishing that in 20 years the Internet has grew from an idea in Tim Berners-Lee’s head for scientists to communicate within universities to more than half of the world using it.</p>
<br>
<p>But how do we use it? Well a lot has changed…</p>
<br>
<p>Compared to how the Worldwide web began, it is now accessible to everyone which has both positive and negative consequences. Research relating to how the internet is used in the world today has found the top 10 most common uses for the internet.</p>
<br>
<ul class="top10list">
   <li>1.	Emailing</li>
   <li>2.	Information gaining</li>
   <li>3.	Business</li>
   <li>4.	Social networking</li>
   <li>5.	Shopping</li>
   <li>6.	Entertainment</li>
   <li>7.	E-commerce</li>
   <li>8.	Services</li>
   <li>9.	Job searching</li>
   <li>10. Dating/Personal</li>
</ul>
<section class="referencelist">
<p>(1stchoicesystems.com, Henrik, 2018)</p>
</section>
<br>
<p>This demonstrates there has been a lot of changes in terms of how it is used, from communication for universities to shopping and dating online. Although it can be seen that the same concept of communicational needs has been fulfilled as Emailing remains to be the most common use for the internet. </p>
<br>
<p>In terms of the changes it has had on our society, there has been big changes. People have become reliant on the internet. It is reported that if the average user spent around 6 and half hours on the internet each day, that is a total of 100 days online each year for that one internet user. (thenextweb.com, Simon Kemp, 2019). If these days each year was multiplied by the 4.4 billion internet users in the world, the population throughout the world will have spent 1.2 billion years online in 2019. This is very alarming for our society because the Internet is becoming a trap for the world to be stuck in, taking away from their everyday social life and allowing people to hide behind screens to communicate, shop and even be entertained. It has also changed our homes, appliances and everyday objects can be used whilst connected to the internet, for example our speakers, watches, and fridges, etc. This shows that it is changing everything we use and frequent ourselves with every day.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Our-future">Our Future</h2>
<br>
<p>The internet is an unpredictable place today, it is very hard to gain an understanding of it from day to day as it is constantly changing and upgrading. I think in the future it will have fully taken over, to be the main source of interest for human beings, you cannot go on a train today without less than 10 people around you ‘surfing the web’, that is scary. </p>
<br>
<p>In terms of how it will sculpt our future, it is hard to call, I did some research to gain an understanding of other people’s views on it, and I found some valid and interesting points which could be possible in 10-20 years’ time.</p>
<br>
<ul class="changespictures">
    <li><img src="img/fridge.png" width="350" height="330"><p>Figure 5, Samsung Fridge connecting to Wi-Fi</p></li>
    <li><img src="img/speaker.png" height="300"><p>Figure 6, Alexa speaker connecting to Wi-Fi</p></li>
  
</ul>
<br>
<p>There are a few speculations as to how the internet will be in the future. There is a thought that the internet will have a constant connection, instead of having to have mobile data, or searching around desperately for the Wi-Fi password, there is speculation that the Internet will have a permanent and automatic connection. (Forbes.com, Jayson DeMers, 2019). This could be through new devices having built-in connections. This source also states that the privacy online could become commoditized, meaning that the rich enough people will be only off the grid, this could be worrying for people that aren’t wealthy enough to afford it as their privacy online will be at danger. (Forbes.com, Jayson DeMers, 2019). As the internet evolves, it also means users and frequent people needing it will have to evolve along with it. This means business, such as online stores for shopping could have to change and may struggle to keep up. In terms of sculpting the future, the internet could prove to be an expensive attribute to life.</p>
<br>
<p>In terms of the future of the new generation in today’s society, they may not have to change much as they will be able to adapt along with it as they grow up, but I believe people that are elderly or will be elderly will struggle as they will get forgotten about and be left behind. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <br>
    <p>To conclude this essay, Tim Berners-Lee has brought something very powerful to world 20 years ago as he created his masterpiece, as it may be very beneficial to everyone, making life easier and allowing it to be fin as they do it. I believe that it will be a bad thing in another 10-20 years. It should be kept for what Tim Berners-Lee set out for it to be, communicational needs to be fulfilled. This means instant messaging and emailing. Not social media for unnecessary posts, as well as online shopping and entertainment. People are being taken away from everyday life and could end up very mentally effected if it were to just stop. Although it is a good thing, it can quickly become something very toxic to the world. </p>
